# BrainSight-AI-Next-Gen-MRI-Based-Tumor-Detection-System
## ✨ Overview

This project applies **Deep Learning** to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI images.  
It combines **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **image preprocessing** techniques to achieve high accuracy.  
Includes a **Jupyter Notebook**, a **Python script** (`main.py`), and a **simple web interface** (`index.html`) for predictions.
